## Introdution

> In this project, we extracted features in order to improve the NER task for people names, locations, organization names in the Arabic language. We used the Maximum Entropy Markov Model that is one of the most prominent sequence models, which is being used extensively in information extraction, namely in NER.

## Dataset
> We used the [ANERcorp](https://camel.abudhabi.nyu.edu/anercorp/) dataset that contains annotated Arabic text.

## Results
> This is the F1 score for the three entities:
> - Person: *0.51*
> - Organization: *0.4*
> - Location: *0.74*
